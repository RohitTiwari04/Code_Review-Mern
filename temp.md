❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add variables `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function scope or
passed as arguments. This will likely lead to an error or unexpected behavior because `a` and `b` are undefined.
* ❌ There are no input parameters defined for the function, meaning it's not clear how the function is supposed to
receive the values to sum.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Added parameters `a` and `b` to the function definition. This allows the function to accept two numbers as input.
* ✔ The function now correctly returns the sum of the two input numbers.

Alternatively, if you intend to use variables from the outer scope (which is generally discouraged due to potential side
effects and reduced readability), ensure those variables are properly defined in that scope:

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 10;

function sum() {
return a + b;
}
```

However, using parameters as in the first "Recommended Fix" example is the better practice.
